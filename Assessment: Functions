# Write a function called int_return that takes an integer as input and returns the same integer.

def int_return(n):
    return int(n)
    


# Write a function called add that takes any number as its input and returns that sum with 2 added

def add(n):
    return (n+2)


# Write a function called change that takes any string, adds “Nice to meet you!” to the end of the argument given, and returns that new string.

def change(n):
    return(n + "Nice to meet you!")


v = 'Peter' 
p = change(v)
print(p)
print(v)


# Write a function, accum, that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of those integers.

def accum(n):
    return(sum(n))


# Write a function, length, that takes in a list as the input.
#  If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 5, return “Longer than 5”. If the length is less than 5, return “Less than 5”.

def length(n):
    if len(n) >= 5:
        return("Longer than 5")
    return("Less than 5") 


# You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2. 
# The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and add 6.


def divide(n):
    return(n / 2)


def sum(i):
    return((i / 2)+6) It should return this new number. You should call the divide function within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals.
